Intelligent Traffic Signal Control using Reinforcement Learning with Partial Detection

This project consists in using Reinforcement Learning on traffic lights in order to reduce traffic congestion.
There is one agent per intersection.
Partial detection means that the algorithm cannot detect all the vehicles due to the absence of V2I (Vehicle to Infrastructure) communication device.

Using PyTorch and SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility).
